    > I've been in crypto since 2010, I mined and then bought Bitcoin early. I was in the original BTC discussion forum. I also participated in the ethereum and cardano ICOs. Prior to that I built and was CEO of a global company covering 6 sectors. I sold that to a VC 15 years ago. I used to run support groups in crpyto for thousands of people to help everyday. I would look for good projects daily and Kitty came up on the radar as part of that. Desi was a member of one of my groups back then too. I now travel the world, moving between living in Asia, Europe and the Americas

    > I have been on and off in crypto since 2017 with seriously only getting into it in 2020. Over my 25 years career, I have served in leadership roles in R&D (research and development) in the biotech industry, having worked with multiple companies that are either established or in the start up space. I have been in $Kitty since late Nov 2021. 
    >
    >My vision for the Kitty Inu DAO is to see it flourish as a non-profit that promotes charity and educational work across the globe using entertainment approaches. I believe the Meme character association combined with the Metaverse and Web3 gaming along with the possibility of a collaboration with 9vrse and using their Kitty Inu character can set the DAO to be successful in achieving these goals while enabling utility for the Kitty Inu token.

    > I have been in crypto since 2019 and still have a lot to learn! I’ve followed Kitty Inu from the start after hearing about the project through one of Adrian’s telegram groups. I have a lot of confidence in the team and have been impressed with the progress and commitment to date. I’m a lawyer by trade with a side focus on crypto regulation and I feel I’d be able to bring some of these skills to help out the Dao committee. I’m looking forward to the journey.

    > I see the Kitty Inu Dao as a source where the talents, energy and ideas of it’s holders come together.   It's a special opportunity to be involved with the Dao from the beginning and it will be exciting to see the direction we evolve
