# Glossary

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Kitty Inu (KITTY)

The native governance token of the Kitty Inu DAO. Holders of Kitty Inu tokens are the members of the DAO and can participate in the governance decisions of the DAO.

## DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)

An organization represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by the organization members and not influenced by a central government.

## Governance Token

A token that gives owners the right to vote on a DAO's decisions. In this case, the Kitty Inu token serves as the governance token for the Kitty Inu DAO.

## ERC20

The Ethereum token standard used for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for implementing tokens. It defines a common list of rules that an Ethereum token has to implement.

## ERC20Burnable

An extension of ERC20 that adds a burn function to allow token holders to destroy both their own tokens and those that they have an allowance for.

## ERC20Snapshot

An extension of ERC20 that enables taking snapshots of token balances. Snapshotting is a way to freeze a certain state, which can be useful for voting, dividends, and more.

## ERC20Permit

An extension of the ERC20 standard that adds a permit function, which allows a holder to allow another account to spend their tokens with a signed message.

## Smart Contract

Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They permit trusted transactions and agreements to be carried out among disparate, anonymous parties without the need for a central authority, legal system, or external enforcement mechanism.

## Ethereum

An open-source, blockchain-based platform that enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps).

## Solidity

An object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Solidity was influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

## ABI (Application Binary Interface)

A specification for smart contract interaction, it is a JSON object defining how to interact with the contract including function names, their inputs, outputs, and the events it emits.

## Web3

A collection of libraries that allow you to interact with a local or remote Ethereum node using HTTP, IPC, or WebSocket.

## MetaMask

A browser plugin, available as a browser extension, that allows users to run Ethereum dApps right in their browser without running a full Ethereum node.

## Gas

A measure of computational effort in Ethereum, it is paid in ether and consumed by operations and computations performed as part of transactions and smart contracts.

## Ether (ETH)

The native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and is used to facilitate transactions on the network.

## Snapshot

In the context of ERC20Snapshot, a snapshot refers to a capture of all token balances at a specific block number.

## Owner

In the context of Ownable and Pausable contracts, the owner refers to the address that has special privileges including pausing and unpausing the contract's functionalities.

## Blockchain

A distributed and decentralized ledger that records all transactions across a network. It allows market participants to keep track of digital transactions without central recordkeeping.

## Decentralization

The transfer of authority, control, and decision-making from a centralized entity to a distributed network. This is a key principle of blockchain networks like Ethereum.

## Token Minting

The process of creating new tokens in a cryptocurrency system. In the context of Kitty Inu, the initial supply of tokens was minted during the contract's deployment.

## Token Burning

The process of permanently removing tokens from circulation, reducing the total supply. This can be done using the burn function in ERC20Burnable contracts.
