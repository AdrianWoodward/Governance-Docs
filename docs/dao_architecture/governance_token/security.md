# Security

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The ERC20 Token

### Industry Standard

The Kitty Inu token contract is built with industry-standard security practices and rigorous checks. It has inherited secure smart contract standards like `ERC20`, `ERC20Burnable`, `ERC20Snapshot`, `Ownable`, `Pausable`, and `ERC20Permit` from the OpenZeppelin library. These standards are widely recognized in the blockchain industry for their robust security assurances, having been extensively audited and proven in countless projects over the years.

### Decentralized Ownership

The `Kitty Inu` contract is [owned by the DAO multisig](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb3bd8cd54f02f2927009e163bdaee496249ee61ecf8e9602a23ccce62f7a188f), specifically a 3-of-5 multisig wallet. This means that for any major operation to be approved, at least three of the five signers must agree and provide their digital signatures.

You can view the DAO multisig wallet on the [SAFE (formerly GNOSIS) application](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0xAe822e37f4Bb4cFA2DbA93cA079Bdf135E5c8b37)

The keys to this multisig wallet are held by the elected committee members of the Kitty Inu DAO, selected through a democratic process as stipulated in the DAO's bylaws. This method ensures that no single entity has absolute control over the contract. It decentralizes authority, reinforces security, and upholds the democratic principles at the core of blockchain technology.

In terms of contract functions that require `onlyOwner` permissions, they can only be executed subject to a vote by the $kitty token holders. This ensures that every significant action undertaken has the backing of the community, reinforcing the principles of transparency, inclusivity, and decentralized decision-making.

The fusion of industry-standard security practices and decentralized ownership makes the Kitty Inu token contract robust, secure, and transparent. It underpins trust and safety in the Kitty Inu ecosystem, reflecting our commitment to community governance and secure, decentralized operations.

## Best Practices

While the contract is secure, the overall security also depends on the practices followed by the end users. Here are some tips to ensure that your Kitty Inu tokens remain secure:

1. **Private Key Management**: Never disclose your private key to anyone. If someone has your private key, they can transfer your tokens without your permission. It's a good practice to use a hardware wallet or a secure wallet software that encrypts your private key.

2. **Check the Contract Address**: Always double-check the contract address before interacting with it. There are malicious actors who deploy contracts with similar names to popular tokens to trick users. The official contract address for Kitty Inu token will be published on our official website and other communication channels.

3. **Be aware of Phishing Attacks**: Be cautious of messages, emails, or websites asking for your private key or mnemonic phrases. No one from the Kitty Inu DAO will ever ask for your private keys.

4. **Gas Fees**: Transacting on Ethereum network requires gas, which is paid in ETH. Ensure you have enough ETH in your wallet to cover the transaction fees.

5. **Use Reputable Exchange Platforms**: If you're buying or selling Kitty Inu tokens, ensure to do it through a reputable and secure exchange platform.

## For Developers:

1. **Check for Updates**: Keep an eye on the official Kitty Inu GitHub repository and official communications for any updates to the contract. It's essential to integrate updates timely to prevent any security issues.

2. **Error Handling**: Implement adequate error handling around interactions with the Kitty Inu contract. The contract uses the 'revert' instruction to throw errors, which should be caught and handled in your code.

3. **Use Secure Environment Variables**: Never hard-code sensitive information like private keys, API keys, or secrets in your code. Use secure environment variables instead.
