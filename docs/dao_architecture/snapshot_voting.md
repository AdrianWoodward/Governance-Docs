# Snapshot Voting for Kitty Inu DAO

Snapshot is an open-source, decentralized voting mechanism that enables off-chain governance for decentralized organizations like the Kitty Inu DAO. It provides a user-friendly, gas-less way for token holders to participate in governance decisions.

## How Snapshot Voting Works

Snapshot uses a simple voting system where each token represents one vote. Votes are not transactions on the blockchain and thus do not require gas fees. Instead, Snapshot takes a "snapshot" of the blockchain at a specific block number to calculate token balances and determine voting weight. Votes are then signed digitally by token holders and stored off-chain.

## Participating in Snapshot Votes

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to participate in Snapshot voting:

1. **Visit the Kitty Inu DAO Snapshot Page**: Visit our [Snapshot page](https://snapshot.org/#/kittyinudao.eth).

2. **Connect Your Wallet**: Click on the 'Connect wallet' button at the top right corner of the page and follow the instructions to connect your Ethereum wallet. Make sure this wallet contains your Kitty Inu tokens.

3. **Choose a Proposal**: Open a proposal you're interested in by clicking on its title. 

4. **Cast Your Vote**: Choose an option and click on the 'Vote' button. You will be asked to sign a message to confirm your vote. There are no transaction fees to vote because you're only signing a message, not conducting a transaction on the blockchain.

5. **Confirm Your Vote**: After you've signed your vote, you can see your vote confirmation on the proposal page. Your vote weight is proportional to the amount of Kitty Inu tokens you held in your wallet at the time the snapshot was taken.

## Proposing a Vote

Only the elected DAO Committee members posts KIPs to Snapshot after ensuring that each one has gone through the correct approvals process outlined in the bylaws.

For information on the proposal process see the bylaws. 

## Conclusion

Snapshot offers an accessible, gas-less way for all Kitty Inu DAO community members to participate in the governance of the DAO. Whether you're voting on proposals or creating new ones, your participation helps shape the future of Kitty Inu DAO.
