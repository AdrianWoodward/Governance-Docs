----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Kitty Inu DAO Bylaws

Version: 1.0

Dated: 04-25-2023

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Article 1 - Definitions and Descriptions

### Section 1.1 - Definitions

**DAO**: Decentralized Autonomous Organization

**Governance Token**: The governance token shall be defined as an ERC20 digital token, known by its formal designation as the “Kitty Inu Token”, with the ticker symbol “kitty”, and contract address [0x61a35258107563f6b6f102ae25490901c8760b12](https://etherscan.io/token/0x61a35258107563f6b6f102ae25490901c8760b12), which grants its holders the authority to participate in decision-making processes, vote on proposals, propose amendments, and contribute to the overall management and direction of the DAO. 

**9VRSE Inc.** : a third-party corporation that owns the Kitty Inu character IP.

### Section 1.2 - Description
The Kitty Inu DAO leverages blockchain technology and decentralization to foster the development and growth of the Kitty Inu token ecosystem. The DAO is owned and managed by the governance token holders. 


## Article 2 – Functions
The Kitty Inu DAO has the following functions:

•    Using a decentralized model, the Kitty Inu DAO provides the community with a framework to submit, discuss and vote on proposals pertaining to the governance token and its ecosystem including changes and improvements to the Kitty Inu ecosystem and the ERC20 governance token contract.

•    The Kitty Inu DAO is responsible for decision making processes such as electing and revoking representatives or making amendments to the constitution (this document).

•    The Kitty Inu DAO controls the Kitty Inu DAO Treasury, a fund dedicated to supporting activities that are beneficial to the Kitty Inu ecosystem. The DAO controls the treasury and can transfer portions of it to provide liquidity for listings on centralized and decentralized exchanges.

•    The Kitty Inu DAO oversees the Kitty Inu DAO official website (address to be determined) and the Kitty Inu social network’s accounts (i.e., @ kittyinuToken on Twitter).
 
## Article 3 – Funding

Upon enactment of these bylaws, the governance tokens held within the liquidity reserves shall be transferred to a designated wallet, of which the DAO shall serve as the custodian. 

The governance tokens held in the custodial wallet shall be utilized for the purpose of financing liquidity provisions to centralized and decentralized exchanges, DAO projects that benefit the Kitty Inu ecosystem, DAO operational expenses, and deflationary initiatives around the token supply, as determined by the decision-making process outlined by these bylaws.

## Article 4 – Membership
### Section 4.1 – Membership
Membership in the DAO is automatically granted to anyone holding the governance token and has abided by the rules outlined in the governance token contract.  No additional action is required.  Participating in proposal submission, commentary and voting is restricted to the DAO members. 

### Section 4.2 – The DAO Committee
The DAO Committee is a group of five individuals who have been elected by the community to:

- Manage the DAO daily operations.

- Hold the keys of a 3-of-5 multi-sig wallet. This multi-sig wallet owns the Kitty Inu contract and the DAO Treasury.

- Set in motion the decisions taken by the DAO. The Committee is responsible for enacting any passed votes involving the Kitty Inu contract or the DAO Treasury.

- Take any emergency action required to guarantee the security of the $kitty ecosystem. In case of a serious security event involving the $kitty ecosystem that could be mitigated by a committee action, the Committee is allowed to act on its own and to take any necessary measure to mitigate the risk.

- Oversee the proposal and voting processes, making sure community members produce compliant proposals, helping them to do so if necessary, and initiating the vote process once a proposal is finalized.

- Represent the DAO in discussions with third parties. When the Committee officially represents the DAO in such events, the Committee must publish a report of the discussions to the DAO.

- Maintains access to the official Kitty Inu DAO website and any social media accounts. They are responsible for elaborating and executing the token communication strategy, following the community formal decisions (through votes) and informal preferences (through consultations and discussions via the DAO communication channels).

The Committee members have to KYC to the other Committee members. They can stay anonymous publicly, but their real identities must be known to each other.

The Committee may be granted a governance token allocation to compensate their members for their work, as decided by a DAO vote.
The Committee is free to organize itself the way it estimates the most efficient to accomplish these goals.

### Section 4.3 – The DAO Committee Election Process

The five DAO Committee members are simultaneously elected by the DAO for 1 year through a regular community voting process (see “the community proposal process” and “the community voting process” sections below).

The DAO Committee members can also be revoked through a regular DAO voting process.

Starting two months before the Committee mandate expires, every governance token holder can submit their candidacy as a committee member through a regular community proposal.

Two weeks before the Committee mandate expires, all the candidacy proposals are submitted to vote for one week.

Each voter can spread their voting power across any number of choices, from one to all. Their voting power will be divided between their chosen options according to how much weight they attribute to each option by increasing or decreasing the voting power fraction.

The first four candidates with the most votes get elected.
The 9VRSE Inc. may also propose a committee candidate. The 9VRSE Inc. candidate gets a distinct vote from the other candidates, where the community must choose between a “Yes”, “No” and “Abstain” vote. If the 9VRSE’s candidate gets a majority of “Yes” votes vs. “No,” the 9VRSE candidate gets elected as the fifth Committee member. If their candidacy is rejected, the fifth candidate with the most votes get elected.

Once the new Committee has been elected, the current Committee has one week to proceed with the transition.

#### Section 4.3.1 – The first DAO Committee Election Process

For the first DAO Committee members election, the period to submit a candidacy is shortened from two months to two weeks.

To ratify this Constitution and to elect the first DAO Committee, an interim Committee made from 3 to 5 three to five members is nominated by the governance token holders in the 9VRSE’s Town Hall Discord channel with the sole purpose of organizing the Constitution ratification and the first DAO Committee election. 

The interim Committee has no special power beyond this mission and is not considered as the DAO Committee and so ’cannot fulfill any of its other responsibilities. The interim Committee is immediately disbanded once the first DAO Committee is elected. If the interim Committee were not able to fulfill their obligations within one month, a new interim Committee could be nominated by the $kitty token holders. 

### Section 4.4 – The DAO Committee Revocation Process

Any Committee member can be revoked through a community vote, which can be initiated by any governance token holder. A revocation proposal must follow the regular community proposal process with some additional requirements:

- The Committee must be composed of five members. If one member has already been revoked, the DAO must first elect a new Committee member before starting another revocation process. (This is needed to keep the multi-sig wallet safe.)

- The proposal must be motivated with objective reasons that would potentially make the Committee member unfit for the role. (Not liking someone is not enough.)

- The date of the Committee members’ last election must have been more than 3 months ago.

- A previous revocation proposal for this Committee member must not have failed in the last 3 months.

The last two requirements do not apply if the revocation proposal comes from a committee member.

When a committee member is revoked, a new election process must be immediately started. Candidates get 3 weeks to submit their candidacies. The vote lasts for one week. The winning candidate is the one with the most votes. Committee members being elected thanks to a special election after a revocation, or a resignation will still have to participate in the next regular yearly election to keep their position.

## Article 5 – Community Project Proposal Process

Everyone holding $kitty can initiate a DAO community proposal, also named Kitty Improvement Proposal (KIP). Once finalized, the proposal is submitted to vote. To ensure proposals are comprehensive, motivated, and implementable, some rules must be followed when submitting a proposal.

### Section 5.1 – The Proposal Template

A Kitty Improvement Proposal must adopt the following template:

- **Title**: A concise title for the proposal.

- **Abstract**: a summary of the proposal. That must be as short and concise as possible. Two or three sentences.

- **Motivation**: a detailed argumentative presentation of the proposal objectives and why the DAO should adopt it.

- **Implementation**: a full and detailed list of the steps necessary to implement the proposal and associated needed resources.

- **Timeline**: any relevant timing details, including but not limited to start date, milestones, and completion dates.

- **Total cost**: the total cost of the proposal’s full implementation.
The author can add as many additional sections as necessary to fully communicate the intentions, specifics, and implications of the proposal.

### Section 5.2 – The Idea Phase

The author of the proposal must first submit it as an idea on the DAO Idea forum. The idea does not have to follow the proposal template. The author must present their idea to the community to gauge community sentiment, to make sure the proposal can be implemented and to determine if there will be enough support for it to possibly pass.

The idea phase must last at least 7 days. Five DAO senior members must at least support an idea to go to the next phase. A DAO senior member is a member holding a minimum amount of $kitty, decided by the DAO. This restriction is used to make sure a proposal cannot be pushed through by fake accounts.

When the idea gets supported by five senior members, the author can proceed to the next phase. If an idea does not get the required amount of support after 7 days, the DAO would reject the idea. A rejected idea cannot be submitted to the DAO again for 3 months.

### Section 5.3 – The Drafting Phase

During the drafting phase, the author must draft a fully compliant proposal, conforming to the proposal template. The author must post the proposal to the DAO proposal forum. The author is expected to answer any question asked by the community and to take into consideration the community desires and concerns, updating their draft accordingly.

The draft phase must last at least 14 days. After 14 days, if the draft gets supported by at least twenty senior members, the author can ask the Committee for their draft to be finalized into a proposal. The Committee can then ask the author to make additional modifications to comply with the DAO formal requirements or to address serious concerns identified by the Committee with the proposal. 

The author MUST address any formal requirements compliance issue (objectives rules set by the DAO to be followed) and SHOULD address concerns emitted by the Committee. If the Committee asked for modifications, the author has 30 days to submit an updated draft. If the Committee considers the updated draft still has outstanding compliance issues, they can ask one last time for changes.

Once the author has sent their final draft to the Committee, the Committee can reject it if the proposal does not comply with the formal DAO obligations previously presented to the author. Otherwise, the Committee must organize a vote for it as soon as possible. If the proposal directly conflicts with a proposal that is currently up for vote, the second proposal should not go for a vote until a decision is made on the first proposal to avoid approval of opposing requirements. 

If the author does not answer the Committee requests after 30 days, or if the proposal thread stays inactive for more than 30 days, the proposal gets rejected.

Once finalized and ready for a vote, the proposal gets attributed a KIP number by the Committee. KIP numbers must be sequential. A rejected draft cannot be submitted again to the DAO for 3 months.

### Section 5.4 – Proposal Voting Phase
Kitty Inu DAO’s consensus mechanism aims to make voting fair, transparent, and low-cost, so every governance token holder can participate in the decision-making of the DAO. Snapshot has been chosen as the DAO’s voting tool as it does not require gas payment and ensures transparency. The voting process is as follows:

- The DAO Committee posts KIPs to Snapshot after ensuring that each one has gone through the correct approvals process.

- DAO members vote on Snapshot. One governance token is equal to one vote. The voting options are “In favor”, “Against”, and “Abstain.” Voting “In favor” means the voter is in favor of implementing the KIP exactly as-is. Voting “Against” means the vote is against implementing the AIP exactly as-is — you may vote “Against” to encourage the author to resubmit the KIP after making changes.

“Abstain” means the voter has no opinion on the proposal.

- The voting period lasts for 7 days.
- DAO members can delegate their vote through the Snapshot delegation feature.
- Only “In favor” and “Against” votes are considered. “Abstain” votes are ignored.
- Proposals that receive a majority of “In favor” votes compared to the “Against” votes are considered adopted and will move into implementation.
- Proposals that are rejected cannot be submitted again for 6 months.

### Section 5.5 – Emergency Proposal
In case of an emergency, a proposal supported by 3 three Committee members can directly go to vote. The nature of the emergency must be specified in the proposal. Voting must last for 7 days.

## Article 6 – The DAO communication channels

### Section 6.1 – Official Communication Channels at the time of Bylaw Initiation

At the time of initiation of these bylaws, the Kitty Inu DAO has recognized and established two primary communication channels:

- **The DAO website**: The DAO website is the DAO central hub, providing all the information related to the DAO activities in a single place like the DAO constitution, the DAO proposals, the DAO latest news and links to the DAO social networks and where to acquire the governance token.
- **Twitter**: The DAO’s official Twitter account (@kittyinutoken) serves as a social media platform for sharing updates, announcements, and engaging with the community around the DAO’s latest activities and general news in the Kitty Inu Ecosystem.
- **Snapshot**: The DAO’s method for voting

### Section 6.2 Creation of Social Media Channels by DAO Members

Any DAO member may propose the creation of a new social channel for the purpose of communication, collaboration, and information dissemination. To propose a new channel, the member shall submit a detailed proposal outlining the channel’s intended purpose, platform, target audience, and management structure.

### Section 6.3 Adoption of Social Channels as Official DAO Communication Tools 
Upon approval of the proposal, the new social channel shall be officially recognized as an authorized communication tool of the DAO. The DAO governing body shall ensure the proper integration and promotion of the channel within the DAO’s existing communication infrastructure. The channel shall be subject to the DAO’s rules, policies, and procedures related to communication and member conduct, as set forth by these bylaws and any subsequent amendments. 

### Section 6.4 Management and Moderation of Social Channels

The management and moderation of the social channels shall be the responsibility of the proposing member, or a designated team of moderators appointed by the proposing member, in accordance with the management structure outlined in the approved proposal. The management and moderation team shall ensure that the social channel operates in compliance with the DAO’s rules, policies, and procedures and shall report any issues, suggestions, or concerns to the DAO’s governing body as necessary. 

### Section 6.5 Periodic Review of Social Channels 

The DAO governing body shall periodically review and evaluate the effectiveness, relevance, and compliance of the social channel with the DAO’s rules, policies, and procedures. The governing body reserves the right to revoke official recognition of a social channel or implement channels to its management structure, should it be determined necessary for the betterment of the DAO, its members, and/or the Kitty Inu Ecosystem. 

## Article 7 – Precedence of the Constitution

For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of conflict between any mission and/or values statement(s) or other similar content or documents and this Constitution, then the terms, obligations and articles of this Constitution shall take precedence and apply.
