# Kitty Inu Overview


## GM, Frens!

Welcome to the Kitty Inu DAO, the purr-fect amalgamation of gaming, creative tech, art, and the underdog spirit of meme coin culture. 

Kitty Inu DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), a democratic ecosystem that's run by the cool cats of the web3 community. We're here to bring a fresh flavor to the DeFi table, and boy, are we feline good about it!

## What is Kitty Inu?

What is the Internet without memes? And what's a meme coin without a meme? Enter Kitty Inu, the heart-meltingly adorable meme at the center of our DAO, licensed from 9VRSE Inc. Think of Kitty Inu as the DAO's spirit animal, guiding our community towards fun, creativity, and some pawsitively lucrative opportunities.

We hold Kitty Inu close to our hearts, but we're also fiercely protective of its image. The character IP is licensed to the DAO for use, meaning we're allowed rights to use kitty for memes, content, and more!
