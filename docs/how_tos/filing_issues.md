2. Click on **Sign up** in the top right corner
3. Fill out the required information, including a username, email address, and password
4. Click **Create account**

## 2. Navigate to the Kitty Inu DAO Repository

Navigate to the [Kitty Inu DAO repositories](https://github.com/Kitty-Inu-DAO). Choose the repository where you want to submit the issue.

## 3. Open the 'Issues' Tab

Once you're in the selected repository, find the 'Issues' tab near the top of the page. Click on it to open.

## 4. Click on 'New Issue'

Inside the 'Issues' tab, there will be a green button labeled 'New Issue'. Click on this button to start creating your issue.

## 5. Fill Out the Form for Bug Reports

On the new page, fill out the form to submit your issue. You'll need to include:
- A title for your issue
- A detailed description of the issue. Try to include as much relevant information as you can, such as steps to reproduce the issue, any error messages you received, and details about your operating system and software versions.

## 6. Submit the Issue

That's it! You've successfully submitted an issue to a GitHub repository. Now, you can wait for a response from the repository maintainers or other contributors. You'll receive notifications about any updates or comments on your issue.

Remember, the more details you provide about your issue, the easier it will be for others to understand and help solve it.
